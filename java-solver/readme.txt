the superperm_sols file I have here is a list of results from my solver, one solution per line.  This can be used with the MakePerms file to spit out actual solutions.  Compared to the solver, this class is a real mess.  If any one wants to clean it up or port it, feel free.
*Solver coming soon (Once I clean it up a bit)*
