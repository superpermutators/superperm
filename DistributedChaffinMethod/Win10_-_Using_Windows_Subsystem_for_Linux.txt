This document covers a simple method to add Linux and associated tooling under Windows 10, 64-bit
in order to download, create & execute DistributedChaffinMethod.  For additional questions about
the tool itself, please refer to the readme.txt instead of this document.

Building and testing
--------------------

 1. Follow instructions on this website to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10.
    *** Must have 64-bit Windows10 ***
    *** Requires Windows10 reboot before step 2 ***

    https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/

 2. Open the Windows Store app; find Ubuntu; Click Get, then Click Install as outlined on website above.

 3. Once Ubuntu download/install finished, complete the install by setting a username/password.  That's all there is to do!

    Enter new UNIX username: user
    Enter new UNIX password:
    Retype new UNIX password:

 4. Update packages [enter password if requested]

    sudo apt-get update
    [sudo] password for user:

 5. Install gcc [enter password if requested]

    sudo apt install gcc

 6. Agree to download packages is prompted.

    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y

 7. Install make

    sudo apt install make

 8. Obtain DistributedChaffinMethod.c and its Makefile in your current directory

    + git is already installed, so clone the entire superpermutators repo if that is your wish:

        git clone https://github.com/superpermutators/superperm
        cp superperm/DistributedChaffinMethod/DistributedChaffinMethod.c .
        cp superperm/DistributedChaffinMethod/Makefile .

    + wget/curl is already installed, so simply grab the two specific files you need if that is your wish:

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superpermutators/superperm/master/DistributedChaffinMethod/DistributedChaffinMethod.c
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superpermutators/superperm/master/DistributedChaffinMethod/Makefile

    + If in doubt, validate the file content

        $ file DistributedChaffinMethod.c
        DistributedChaffinMethod.c: C source, ASCII text, with very long lines
        $ file Makefile
        Makefile: makefile script, ASCII text

    + If you used the wrong github URL, you might see this instead

        $ file Makefile
        Makefile: HTML document, UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines

 9. Compile the program

    $ make
    gcc -O3    DistributedChaffinMethod.c   -o DistributedChaffinMethod

10. Test the program

    $ ./DistributedChaffinMethod test
    Random seed is: 1558087104
    Fri May 17 01:43:33 2019 Program instance number: 1932335239
    Fri May 17 01:43:33 2019 Team name: anonymous
    Fri May 17 01:43:33 2019 To server: action=hello
    Fri May 17 01:43:41 2019 Server: Hello world.

Bonus
-----

Python3 is also installed by default, should you wish to play with other content from the superpermutators github repo.

    $ python3 -V
    Python 3.6.5

Installation of additional Python modules may be necessary, but are outside the scope of this document.
