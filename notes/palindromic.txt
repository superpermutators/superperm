Oversimplified and informal algorithm to generate palindromic superpermutations

Kara


 Quick definitions
===================

Given a set of elements S, all the permutations of those elements must be
present in a list of elements from set S in order for that list to be a
superpermutation on the set S. I'll be using the term "set S" to refer to this
specific set of elements.

Palindromic superpermutations are usually not minimal superpermutations. Their
length is determined by the partial sum p(n) (equation 1), where n is the
number of elements in the set S.

                n
(1)    p(n) :=  Σ (x!)
               x=1



 Introduction
==============

I got inspiration from Heap's algorithm for generating permutations [1].

In order to generate palindromic superpermutations, we neet to utilize a
counting method using a list of mixed-base digits (single-digit numbers),
where ,when performing addition, an overflow of one digit is carried onto the
next digit in the list. This is identical to a mixed-radix number of the form:

       d1_b(n), d2_b(n-1), d3_b(n-2), ..., d(n-1)_b2, dn_b1

Each digit is identified by d1, d2, ..., dn, and each digit's base is
identified by b1 (base-1), b2 (base-2), and so on. The thing we're really
interested in here is the last digit to overflow (carry) when incrementing by
one. For n=4 the sequence looks something like this:

       1,1,1,1, 2, 1,1,1,1, 2, 1,1,1,1, 2, ..., 3, ..., 2, ...

In other words, it's like:

        four 1's, then carry to 2.  <- (We're only ever adding 1)
        three 2's, then carry to 3.
        two 3's, then carry to 4.
        one 4, then stop.

Once you carry to digit 4, the superpermutation will be complete.

Unrelated: something I'm working out right now is how to generate any
superpermutation of length p(n), generally, by modifying the phase of the
sequence or the sequence itself.

 Algorithm
===========

I still need to prove this works, but this is how I figured to do it.

We start with a list of elements from the set S, which is a valid permutation.
For example, you may choose the list:

        [ 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n ]

Given the values produced by the sequence described above as x, we perform the
following steps:

 1.) Rotate the permutation to the left by x.
     This is done by splicing the last (n - x) digits to the left of the first
     x digits. If x is 2,
       [ 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n ] |-> [ 3, 4, ..., n, 1, 2 ]

 2.) Reverse the order of the right-most x digits.
       [ 3, 4, ..., n, 1, 2 ] |-> [ 3, 4, ..., n, 2, 1 ]

 3.) Print out the right-most x digits as items in the superpermutation.
       print "21"

If the carry from the sequence described above reaches the last digit (4, in
the example) then you'd stop before doing these steps. Otherwise, you'd have
the same list of elements in the same order as when you started.

Runs in O(n!), obviously.
